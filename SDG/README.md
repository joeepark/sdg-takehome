Hello!

Here is my submission for SDG's takehome.

I really enjoyed recreating the tab and accordian mockups. The assignment is done using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I tried to seperate the 2 components into categories as "tab" and "accordian" throughout the file. I also created some media queries for mobile devices making sure the design was fit for mobile first. Creating CSS transitions was a little tricky. I had a finished product and as I was adding a few transitions they didn't look as nice as I was hoping, so I decided to leave it out and submit it with a finished look. 

Thank you for your time and consideration.
